# About me:
Having studies at the Linguistic university, I have always been exposed to various languages, including programming languages, as my course was of Theoretical and Applied linguistics. Over the course of my studies I have been taught JavaScript, C#, C, and Python on numerous occasions, but it was only after the graduation that I realized how interestsing these languages could actually be. Since I rediscovered my interest in programming languages I started looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills as well as improve on them. I'm a fast learner, a critical thinker, and a perfectionist to an extent. 
* My strength:
  - Communicative skills
  - Perseverence
  - Not afraid to take on responsability
  - Able to understand the process from within
# Skills
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- React
- Bootstrap 
- Webpack
# Code Examples 
__Discription__
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!
__Code__
```
function getSum(a, b) {
  let sum = 0;
  if(a < b){ 
    for(let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
      sum += i; 
    }
    return sum;
  } else if(a > b){
      for(let i = b; i <= a; i++) {
      sum += i; 
    }
    return sum;
  } else {
    return a;
  } 
}
```
